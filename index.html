<h3>Round 1: Technical Interview</h3>
<p>
    I entered the interview room and greeted the two interviewers with a smile, shaking hands and introducing myself. After handing over two copies of my resume, one to each interviewer, the session began. The first interviewer quickly reviewed my resume and asked me to introduce myself. I provided a brief overview, mentioning my name, department, and recent software engineering internship at SRIB, along with the projects I worked on, my technical skills, soft skills, leadership roles, and hobbies. This introduction helped build a rapport with the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
    One of the interviewers seemed particularly interested in my internship at SRIB and asked me to explain more about it. I gave a clear explanation of the project, the methodology followed, the challenges faced, and how they were addressed. He also pointed to a system design principle, "asynchronous communication," which I had mentioned on my resume and used during the project, and asked me to elaborate on it. He further inquired why I needed to make changes to the existing GitHub repository code for the project that was implemented on the device during my internship. During this discussion, I took the opportunity to align the skills and values I developed during the internship with SAP's values.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the interviewer asked about SHA-256, which I had implemented in my DBMS project. He asked detailed questions about SHA, hashing, cryptography, and also brought up the salt and pepper method in hashing. Then, he asked an interesting question: why do companies send password reset links instead of revealing the password when the "forgot password" option is selected? Many of the questions revolved around data privacy and security, which was a key focus of the team I was interviewing with.
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then asked if I was familiar with system design practices. I mentioned that I was not, but I expressed a strong interest in learning more about it after the interview. He was understanding and appreciated my willingness to explore new areas. Moving on to OOP concepts, he asked me to explain composition, which I illustrated with real-world examples. We also discussed inheritance, where I provided a real-world analogy and explained how inheritance is implemented in Java using the <em>extends</em> keyword.
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then moved on to DSA questions. The first problem involved maximizing the number of 'A's on a text editor, given four keys: A, copy, paste, and select all, with N keystrokes. I described the approach I would take and explained recursion and backtracking using the subset sum problem as an example. He seemed satisfied with my explanation. The next question was the stock buy and sell problem. I wrote the pseudocode, traced it for correctness, and he appeared content with my solution.
</p>
<p>
    While the first interviewer was asking these technical questions, the second interviewer was observing me closely. He then took over and presented two puzzles. The first puzzle involved 50 red and 50 blue balls and two buckets, where I was asked how to maximize the probability of drawing a blue ball. The second puzzle was a variation of the mislabeled jars problem. I had studied these types of puzzles beforehand, especially from the top 100 interview puzzles on GFG, which helped me solve them with confidence.
</p>
<p>
    Toward the end, the interviewer asked why I wanted to join SAP. I explained my reasons, highlighting some of SAP's products, and even referenced the fact that our collegeâ€™s marks portal was powered by SAP. Lastly, I was given the opportunity to ask questions, where I inquired about the role. The interview concluded on a positive note.
</p>


            <h3>Round 2: Hiring Managerial Interview</h3>
            <p>In this round, I had an in-depth conversation about my <em>internships</em> and <strong>research work</strong>. I aligned my experiences with the company's values and goals.</p>

            <h3>Round 3: HR Interview</h3>
            <p>The final round focused on personal details, my motivations for pursuing engineering, and achievements. The HR interviewer appreciated my <strong>academic background</strong> and <strong>extra-curricular involvement</strong>.</p>
