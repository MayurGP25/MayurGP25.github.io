<h3>Round 1: Technical Interview</h3>
<p>
    I entered the interview room and greeted the two interviewers with a smile, shaking hands and introducing myself. After handing over two copies of my resume, one to each interviewer, the session began. The first interviewer quickly reviewed my resume and asked me to introduce myself. I provided a brief overview, mentioning my name, department, and recent software engineering internship at SRIB, along with the projects I worked on, my technical skills, soft skills, leadership roles, and hobbies. This introduction helped build a rapport with the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
    One of the interviewers seemed particularly interested in my internship at SRIB and asked me to explain more about it. I gave a clear explanation of the project, the methodology followed, the challenges faced, and how they were addressed. He also pointed to a system design principle, "asynchronous communication," which I had mentioned on my resume and used during the project, and asked me to elaborate on it. He further inquired why I needed to make changes to the existing GitHub repository code for the project that was implemented on the device during my internship. During this discussion, I took the opportunity to align the skills and values I developed during the internship with SAP's values.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the interviewer asked about SHA-256, which I had implemented in my DBMS project. He asked detailed questions about SHA, hashing, cryptography, and also brought up the salt and pepper method in hashing. Then, he asked an interesting question: why do companies send password reset links instead of revealing the password when the "forgot password" option is selected? Many of the questions revolved around data privacy and security, which was the team I was applying to, that I was told during the end of the interview!
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then asked if I was familiar with system design practices. I mentioned that I was not but I did mention him that I was aware about horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, caching.I then expressed a strong interest in learning more about it after the interview. He was understanding and appreciated my willingness to explore new areas. Moving on to OOP concepts, he asked me to explain composition, which I illustrated with real-world examples. We also discussed inheritance, where I provided a real-world analogy and explained how inheritance is implemented in Java using the <em>extends</em> keyword.
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then moved on to DSA questions. The first problem involved maximizing the number of 'A's on a text editor, given four keys: A, copy, paste, and select all, with N keystrokes. I described a dynamic programming approach. The interview then asked about backtracking and explained it using the combination sum problem as an example. He seemed satisfied with my explanation. The next question was the stock buy and sell problem. I wrote the pseudocode, traced it for correctness, discussed the time and space complexity of my approach and he appeared content with my solution. 
</p>
<p>
   The interviewer then asked me to explain about word embeddings in layman's terms as I had used it in my project. While the first interviewer was asking these technical questions, the second interviewer was observing me closely. He then took over and presented two puzzles. The first puzzle involved 50 red and 50 blue balls and two buckets, where I was asked how to maximize the probability of drawing a blue ball. The second puzzle was a variation of the mislabeled jars problem. I had studied these types of puzzles beforehand, especially from the top 100 interview puzzles on GFG, which helped me solve them with confidence.
</p>
<p>
    Toward the end, the second interviewer asked why I wanted to join SAP. I explained my reasons, highlighting some of SAP's products, and even referenced the fact that our college’s marks portal was powered by SAP. Lastly, I was given the opportunity to ask questions, where I inquired about the role and I asked feedback. The interview concluded on a positive note and I was quickly sent to Hiring Managerial Round.
</p>

<h3>Round 2: Hiring Managerial Interview</h3>
<p>
    I entered the room with a smile and greeted the interviewer before handing over my resume. The interviewer quickly glanced at my resume, reading out my CGPA, 12th-grade score, and KCET rank. She then noticed my two internships at Samsung and expressed her admiration for the experiences I had gained during those opportunities. 
</p>
<p>
    After this, she inquired about my family background and my plans for pursuing a master's degree. When I mentioned that I was not planning to pursue one immediately, she asked me to explain why I had chosen this path. We had a thoughtful discussion about my decision to focus on gaining industry experience before considering further education.
</p>
<p>
    The conversation then shifted to my research paper. The interviewer asked me to explain the subject of the research, where it was presented, and the impact it had. After that, the focus moved to an AIML-based project I had worked on. She asked for details about the dataset, the methodology used, and where the novelty lay in the project. We had an engaging discussion about the project, and I could tell she was genuinely interested in the work I had done.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the interviewer turned her attention to the achievements section of my resume, where I provided a brief overview of my accomplishments. She then asked me an important question: given my internships at Samsung and my selection for the Amazon ML Summer School, why was I interested in joining SAP? I explained my strong interest in SAP, referring to a talk held at my college during the first year of my engineering degree. I also highlighted some of SAP's products and expressed how my skills, enthusiasm for innovation, and long-term goals aligned with SAP’s values.
</p>
<p>
    The interview concluded with a discussion about the role itself and the positive impact of AI within the team at SAP. The conversation ended on a positive note and I was sent to the final HR round!
</p>

<h3>Round 3: HR Interview</h3>
<p>
    After the second round, I was immediately called for the HR interview. I entered the room with a calm state of mind, a smile on my face, and handed over my resume to the HR interviewer. The interview began with some basic questions about my CGPA, 10th and 12th-grade marks, as well as my KCET and COMEDK ranks, which he noted down on his laptop. He seemed particularly interested in how I managed to secure such an impressive KCET rank and asked about the strategy I followed to achieve it.
</p>
<p>
    Following this, we had an interesting discussion about the book *Atomic Habits*, which has the theory of compounded effect of good habits. The HR then shifted the conversation to my decision to pursue engineering, asking if it was something I had been passionate about or if I had been pressured into it. I explained that my choice was driven purely by my interest and passion for technology and problem-solving.
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then focused on the achievements section of my resume, asking me to go over each achievement in detail. I gave a brief explanation of the key accomplishments, highlighting the skills I developed through them. The discussion then turned to my future plans, specifically regarding higher education. He asked why I had not planned to pursue a master’s degree, and I explained my current focus on gaining industry experience before considering further studies.
</p>
<p>
    Toward the end, the HR asked why I was interested in joining SAP. I reiterated my alignment with SAP’s values of innovation, excellence, and teamwork, and discussed how my experiences reflect those values. I also mentioned some of SAP’s products and brought up the SAP talk that had taken place at our seminar hall during my first year at college, which had sparked my initial interest in the company. 
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer then gave me an overview of the role, its requirements, and how my skills will be potential match for the role. He also told about AI being used extensively at SAP and I also mentioned about GenAI being used in SAP S/4HANA platform. Finally, when asked if I had any questions, I asked my feedback and the interview concluded.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, all three rounds of my interview were completed in about 1.5 hours, and I truly appreciate the hiring team of SAP for making the entire interview process comfortable and engaging.
</p>
 <p>
      Final Verdict: Selected!! Totally 6 people were selected across 3 teams the company was hiring for on that day.
